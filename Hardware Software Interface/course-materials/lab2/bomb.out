Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
That's number 2.  Keep going!
Halfway there!
So you got that one.  Try this one.
Congratulations! You've (mostly) defused the bomb!
Hit Control-C to escape phase 6 (for free!), but if you want to
try phase 6 for extra credit, you can continue.  Just beware!

BOOM!!!
The bomb has blown up.
